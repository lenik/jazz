/**
 * Not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element â€” the element is primarily intended
 * for sections that consist of major navigation blocks. In particular, it is common for footers to
 * have a short list of links to various pages of a site, such as the terms of service, the home
 * page, and a copyright page. The footer element alone is sufficient for such cases; while a nav
 * element can be used in such cases, it is usually unnecessary.
